Module 1 : Application Development Fundamentals

	DevOps is a process automatic the end-to-end CI-CD.
	DevOps is a Software Development Strategy which helps to promote the colaboration between the teams like (DEV,Operations) to achieve CI, CD in more automated fashion.
	
	Continuous Development
	Continuous Integration
	Continuous Delivery
	Continuous Testing
	Continuous Deployment
	Continuous Monitoring
	
SDLC :

	Software Development Life Cycle:
	
		1. Requirement Analysis
		2. Design
		3. Implement - Coding / Development 
		4. Testing 
		5. Deployment 
		6. Monitoring
	
	
	Waterfall Model: --- Implemented in a Linear Fashion.
			
		1. Requirement Analysis
		2. Design
		3. Implement - Coding / Development 
		4. Testing 
		5. Deployment 
		6. Monitoring
	
	We can't achieve: Continuous Development, Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment 
	
	Agile Methodologies:
	
		1. Requirement Analysis
		2. Design
		3. Implement - Coding / Development 
		4. Testing 
		5. Deployment 
		6. Monitoring
	
	We can achieve : Continuous Development, Continuous Delivery. But not Continuous Deployment 
	
Web Application :

		Process involved --> Sign-up, Sign-in, inbox, compose  --- all these process are considerd as one whole application
		
	DevOps : 
		
	We can achieve : Continuous Development, Continuous Delivery as well as Continuous Deployment 	
	

In general, :: 	Monolith Application 
					Process involved --> Sign-up, Sign-in, inbox, compose  --- all these process are considerd as one whole application
				
				Microservice based architecture
					Process involved --> Sign-up, Sign-in, inbox, compose  --- all these process are considerd as individual Micro-service

Calculator program:
func : + - / *

Project :

	1. User Registeration - Sign-up
	2. Sign-in							---> User-Interface  textboxes, button controls, validations :: UserName : email_ID --> 2adfas@gmail.com
	3. Search 
	4. Add to cart
	5. place order
		delivery addr
	6. payment							---> payment --> code changes -- build -- create artifacts -- deliver for further testing -- deploy to prod
	7. track
	



How to do achieve Micro-service based Applications

	JAVA 


	DEV Team ===> Java programming Lang. - coding is done -- ? Test -- ? Deployment -- ? 
		
	Continuous Development	
		code(*.java/*.jsp) - build(Compile the source code) - create artifacts(*.war) - deploy(QA/UAT/Pre-Prod/PROD)  ---> Linux servers
		
	Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery  - script!!!
		code(*.java/*.jsp) - build(Compile & create artifacts of the source code) - created artifacts(*.war) - deploy(QA/UAT/Pre-Prod/PROD)  ---> Linux servers
		

	Continuous Delivery   		(vs)		Continuous Deployment
	
	Need Manual Approval for 				Without Manual Approval We can perform PROD deployments
	PROD Deployments

Configure the servers 		Installation/management of software or appln packages 	
								Configuration Management Tool : Ansible / puppet / chef 

Non-Prod Environment		 							
DEV,QA,UAT

Through DevOps automation, using Terraform like tools we need to dynamically create the test servers, configure test servers using ansible, Test the Application, once the testing is completed, Delete the test servers.

all these non-prod servers shd be available only during the business hours.

But, prod servers shd be up and running 24/7

Loops are used in any programming language to execute the same code repeatedly. Three types of loops are mainly used in programming for doing repetitive tasks. These are for, while, and do-while/repeat-until loop. You can apply for loop on bash script in various ways. Some useful BASH for loop examples has been mentioned in this article.

Syntax of for loop:

# loop through a list
for value in list
do
    commands
done

# loop specified values
for value in file1 file2 file3
do
    commands
done

# loop through strings resulting from a command
for value in $(Linux command)
do
    commands
done

# loop through increment or decrement numbers
# traditional procedural for loop
for (( i=0; i<10; i++)
do
    commands
done

According to the above syntax, the starting and ending block of for loop is defined by do and done keywords in the bash script.



Example-1: Reading static values
Create a bash file named loop1.sh with the following script to read the values from a list using for loop. In this example, 5 static values are declared in the lists. This loop will iterate 5 times, and each time, it will receive a value from the lists and store it in the variable named color that will print inside the loop.


#!/bin/bash
# Define loop to read string values
for color in Blue Green Pink White Red
do
    # Print the string value
    echo "Color = $color"
done


Example-2: Reading Array Variable
You can use for loop to iterate the values of an array. Create a new bash file named loop2.sh with the following script. In this example, the loop retrieves the values from an array variable named ColorList, and it will print the output only if the Pink value is found in the array elements.


#!/bin/bash
# Declare and array
ColorList=("Blue Green Pink White Red")
# Define loop to  iterate the array values
for color in $ColorList
do
    # Check the value is pink or not
    if [ $color == 'Pink' ]
    then
            echo "My favorite color is $color"
    fi
done



Example-3: Reading Command-line arguments

Command-line arguments values can be iterated by using for loop in bash. Create a new bash file named loop3.sh with the following script to read and print the command-line argument values using for loop.

#!/bin/bash
# Define loop to read argument values
for myval in $*
do
    # Print each argument
    echo "Argument: $myval"
done




Example-4: Finding odd and even number using three expressions
The C-style syntax of for loop is three expression syntax. The first expression indicates initialization, the second expression indicates termination condition, and the third expression indicates increment or decrement. Create a bash file named loop4.sh with the following script to find out the odd and even numbers from 1 to 5.


#!/bin/bash

# Define for loop in C-style format
for (( n=1; n<=5; n++ ))
do  
    # Check the number is even or not
    if (( $n%2==0 ))
    then
        echo "$n is even"
    else
        echo "$n is odd"
    fi  
done

=,-,/,* = %


Example-5: Reading file content
You can use for loop to read the content of any file by using the ‘cat’ command. Suppose you have a file named ‘weekday.txt‘ which contains the name of all weekdays. Now, create a bash file named loop5.sh to read and print the content of the file.

#!/bin/bash
# Initialize the counter
i=1
# Define for loop to read the text file
for var in `cat weekday.txt`
do
    # Print the file content
    echo "Weekday $i: $var"
    ((i++))
done


Example-6: Create infinite for loop

Create a bash named loop6.bash with the following script to know the way to declare infinite for loop. Here, the loop will iterate for infinite times and print the counter value until the user presses Ctrl+C.

#!/bin/bash
# Initialize counter variable
counter=1
# Display message for termination
echo "Press Ctrl+c to terminate from the loop"
# Define infinite loop
for (( ;; ))
do
   # Print the number of iteration
   echo "Iterating for $counter time(s)."
   # Wait for 1 second
   sleep 1
   # Increment the counter
   ((counter++))
done



Example-7: Use of for loop with command substitute
Create a bash file named loop7.bash with the following script to know the use of for loop to read and print the command output.

#!/bin/bash
echo "All bash files starting with 'a' are:"

# Read the output of command substitute using for loop
for val in $(ls a*.bash)
do
    # Print the file name
    echo "$val"
done


Example-8: Conditional exit with break
Create a bash file named loop8.bash with the following script to know the way to exit from the loop based on any particular condition.

#!/bin/bash
# Define a for loop to iterate 10 times
for (( i=1; i<=10; i++ ))
do  
    # Define the conditions to terminate the loop
    if (( $i%3==0 && $i%6==0 ))
    then
        # Terminate from the loop
        echo "Terminated."
        break
    else
        # Print the current value of i
        echo "The current value of i is: $i"
    fi  
done

Example-9: Early continuation with continue statement

Create a bash file named loop8.bash with the following script to know how to omit one or more statement(s) from the loop by using a continuous statement based on the particular condition.

#!/bin/bash
# Declare an associative array
declare -A Applicants
# Intialize the array values
Applicants=( [1022]="Present" [1034]="Present" [1045]="Absent" [1067]="Present" )

echo "List of the applicant's ID who are present:"
for k in ${!Applicants[@]}
do
     # Filter the applicant's ID who are absent
     if [ ${Applicants[$k]} == "Absent" ]; then
        continue
     else
        # Print the applicant's ID who are present
        echo $k
     fi
done


echo "enter number"
read num
function prime
{
for((i=2; i<=num/2; i++))
do
  if [ $((num%i)) -eq 0 ]
  then
    echo "$num is not a prime number."
    exit
  fi
done
echo "$num is a prime number."
}
r=`prime $number`
echo "$r"
